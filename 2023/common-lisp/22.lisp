;;; Problem 1

; the goal is to find the number of bricks that can be disintegrated safely.

; a brick can be disintegrated safely (without causing others to fall)
; unless a brick it supports is supported by no other bricks.

; due to the shape and alignment of bricks, if A supports B and B supports C,
; A cannot reach C to directly support it. so transitive support is not important.

; a brick supports another when its upper bound z equals the other's
; offset and their x, y rects intersect.â€¨it looks like the horizontal dimensions are
; 10x10, and the vertical dimension is in the hundreds.

; now, how to settle the bricks? i think you could sort them by lower z and then
; insert one at a time, placing them as low as they will go.

; we could begin with a 10x10 grid of references to the topmost brick placed
; in that column, initially all blank.

; to insert a brick, use topmost-brick-index to find the topmost bricks
; in each column of the brick's x, y range. among those, determine the maximum
; upper bound z value, or 1 if there are none.
; then make a copy of the brick with the z offset set to sit atop that height.
; finally reference the newly inserted brick with the x, y range of the inserted brick.
