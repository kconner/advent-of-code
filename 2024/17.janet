# 3-bit computer. a word is a number, 0-7
# instruction: [opcode operand]
# - each is one word.
# program is read into memory and kept there. that's an array
# instruction pointer is an index into that array
# halt when trying to read IP out of bounds ("past the end")

# (implemntations of each opcodeâ€¦)

# Your first task is to determine what the program is trying to output.
# To do this,
# - initialize the registers to the given values, then
# - run the given program,
#   - collecting any output produced by :out instructions.
#   - (Always join the values produced by :out instructions with commas.)
# After one exampleabove program halts, its final output will be
# 4,6,3,5,6,3,5,2,1,0.

# - initialize the registers to the given values,
# - then run the program.
# - what do you get if you use commas to join the values it output into a single
#   string?
